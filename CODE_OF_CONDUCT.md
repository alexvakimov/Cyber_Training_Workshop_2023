## Workshop Objectives

* Get **familiar with a variety of software packages** relevant to modeling of excited states and nonadiabatic dynamics
* Get an overview of **theoretical background** for corresponding computational methods
* Get a **practical experience** with these tools and packages


## Project rules

* Consist of: a) short written report, b) presentation at the last day of workshop; c) set of input/output files deposited on the GitHub repository
* Should actively involve one of the packages discussed over the workshop period 
* Preferably not something you have an extensive experience with 
* Doesn't have to be a full-scale research project, but can be a step towards this direction
* Projects completed using local or home institution resources are eligible
* Can be an application or a coding project
* The consistency in your course work during this school will contribute to your chances to win the awards
* The awards decisions will be made based on the committee evaluation. The awards will be: 1 first prize ($300), 3 second, and 5 third prizes.
