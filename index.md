# Excited States and Nonadiabatic Dynamics CyberTraining Workshop 2023

## About the Summer School and Workshop

The CyberTraining workshop aims to educate graduate students, postdocs, researchers, and educators working in a 
broader field of nonadiabatic and excited-state dynamics as well as in computational material sciences in a variety
of tools and methods for such types of calculations. The workshop will provide conceptual and practical hands-on 
training in a range of methods and cyberinfrastructure (software and platforms) for modeling excited state and 
nonadiabatic dynamics in abstract models and atomistic materials. We will also cover tools and workflows for 
building atomistic models, computing excited states of molecular and periodic systems, as well as pre- and post-processing 
operations, and data analysis. 

Participants not only will learn about using the tools but will be exposed to the underlying machinery 
of such methods and will be familiarized with their development. The programming-driven nature of the school will
help the participants to go beyond the standard computational chemistry curriculum. The workshop will culminate with 
a capstone project presentation, through which the participants will demonstrate their ability to leverage the new tools 
in their active research. 

Keywords and topics:

- nonadiabatic dynamics
- excited states
- quantum dynamics
- quantum-classical methods
- charge transfer
- excitation energy transfer
- trajectory surface hopping
- coupled trajectories
- exact factorization
- TD-DFT, CASSCF, GW/BSE
- algorithms and methods
- software, programming, Python
- best practices, Git, GitHub

 
The school aims to provide training in a range of advanced tools for excited state and 
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations. 
This year, the focus will be on the following packages:

- Libra (Akimov)
- TBD (TBD)

The school will leverage the [OnDemand](https://ondemand.ccr.buffalo.edu) gateway at the University at Buffalo

## Participation
### How to apply to the school

1. Read this page carefully
2. Prepare your application package (you will need it in the next steps)

   2.1. your CV (including graduate or undergraduate GPA)

   2.2. a statement of purpose PDF should describe in no more than 2 pages:

   * your current/ongoing research projects and interests; 
   * how you plan to use the CyberTraining skill gained in this workshop in your research, for instance if you expect using any of the
     packages that will be covered at this workshop (see the agenda);
   * propose at least one potential project to be completed during and shortly after the summer school; the project will be presented shortly after 
     the event (within 1 week). It should leverage one or more tools/software covered during the workshop (see the agenda). The quality and feasibility 
     of the proposed workshop projects will be considered during the selection of the participants. 
         
   2.3. request your advisor to submit a letter of recommendation for you to the following email: "alexeyak AT buffalo DOT edu", 
   please replace "AT" and "DOT" with the corresponding characters

3. Complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/91tpbpe98Q6RHdkv9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">**Registration form**</a>


### Important dates
   * Workshop application materials are due 5 pm EDT, May 1, 2023
   * Students and Postdocs will be notified of their admission by May 11, 2023
   * Workshop starts: 9 am EDT, June 11, 2023
   * Workshop ends: 5 pm EDT, June 21, 2023


### Who can apply

This summer school is for graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty (and undergraduate in exceptional cases)
working in computational modeling of excited states and nonadiabatic dynamics, both in abstract and atomistic
applications/problems. The school aims to help researchers/students working either in 
methodology development for nonadiabatic or quantum-classical dynamics and in 
applied studies of various types of solar energy materials (photovoltaics, photocatalytics, etc.). 

Postdocs and researchers wishing to acquire the practical experience with new simulation
tools and expand their knowledge in the areas of excited states and nonadiabatic dynamics
are also welcome to participate.


### Selection and restrictions

* **Competitive selection** The applicants will be selected based on the strength of their statement of purpose, as well as the adequate 
  support of their supervisors and their level of fundamental preparation. The lack of training in specialized methods and software is not a problem. 
  What is more important is how ready the applicants are to absorb the new knowlege, how efficiently they can operate during the workshop, 
  and how critical the use of the methods/tools covered in the workshop may be for your future research or career (e.g. educating others). 

* **Capacity.** This year, the event will take place in the in-person format. We will accommodate 15+ in-person participants (excluding instructors).
