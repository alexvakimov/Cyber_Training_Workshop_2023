 The Intel 20.1 compilers are in your path. This is adequate for compiling and
running most codes. Source compilervars.sh for more features including the
debugger. 
 The Intel MPI 2020.1 is in your path. This is adequate for compiling and
running most codes. Run "source
/util/academic/intel/20.1/compilers_and_libraries_2020.1.217/linux/mpi/intel64/bin/mpivars.sh"
for more features including the debugger. 
 The MKL Libraries are in your library path. This is adequate for compiling and
running most codes. Source $MKL/bin/mklvars.sh" for more features. 

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) intel-mpi/2020.2 => intel-mpi/2020.1     2) intel/20.2 => intel/20.1

 WARNING: Found keyword wavefunction_cutoff in the input file.
          This option is obsolete, use program wfnreduce instead.

 WARNING: distribution is not ideal, number of valence and conduction bands
  350 should be divisible by number of processors per pool   12
 WARNING: |eqp0 - ecor| > finite_difference_spacing
   Linear extrapolation for eqp1 may be inaccurate.
   You should test the validity of eqp1 by rerunning
   calculation with self-energy evaluated at the eqp0
   energies. For that, use the eqp_outer.dat file
   created with eqp.py script and point WFN_outer to WFN_inner.

All Done!
