# Nathan Jansen Project

## Introduction

Main project: LiAlH4 Dynamics with Libra
Goes through tutorial 6-nbra dynamics for LiAlH4

Step 1 & 2 get energies and intial trajectories,

Step 3, compares sd and mb NACs

Step 4, compares methods FSSH, IDA, mSDM, DISH, mSDM2, DISH2 (except not DISH bc I couldn't get it to work!)

Side Projects: LVC Surfacing Hopping, Thiourical and cis-butadiene

td-DFT level energies, LVC techniques for surface hopping. cis-bute didn't work all that well, fitting was weird with thiouracil.
