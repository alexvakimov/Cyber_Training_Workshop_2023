Understand the strong emission in BBTA

## introduction
BBTA was synthesized by Chen et. al.[1] It shows strong fluorescence at 568 nm and large Stoke's shift of 186 nm in buffer solution. It is found to have high photostability and low cytotoxicity. The goal of this small project is to understand the origin of strong emission of BBTA.

## methods
Geometry is optimized in Gaussian using PBEPBE functional and 6-31G(d) basis set.
Molecular dynamics, computation of nonadiabatic dynamics and Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (FSSH) calculations are performed in Libra/CP2k interface.

## Summary
Successful to perform steps 1 to 4 in Libra/CP2k to study the nonadiabatic dynamics.
