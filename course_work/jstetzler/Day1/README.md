Results and exercises completed from Day 1
Did Exercies 1 of Random numbers basics in Libra

Did Exercises 1-4 of the Gaussian wavepackets tutorial in Libra

Did the QTAG example, also changed the mass from 1 to a lerger mass (much smaller inverse mass) and found at this limit that the calculations appear to become unstable and through the simulation no population propagates to a new state (likely because the large mass is trapped in the well) but the population of the ground state still decreases resulting in a loss of total pop. and a large (60%) error.
