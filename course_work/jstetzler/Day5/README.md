Day 5

Results from COBRAMM, ORCA, and SHARC trajectory analysis

For COBRAMM was only able to get to the thermilization and equilibraition of all geometries, ran into errors for rest of the workflow and did not geta chance to fix them.

For SHARC trajectories also only made it to the fitting of results and ran into errors but the rest of the analysis was completed.
