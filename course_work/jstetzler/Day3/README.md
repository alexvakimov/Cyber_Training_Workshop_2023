Exercises for Day 3

Worked through Dynemol examples 1,3, and 5. Didn't run 2 and 4 due to there size and didn't want to occupy nodes for very long for demos

Worked through the AMBER tutorial as well for the 2af1 example, made it to the sander step and got some initial data but again job was timed out. Also could not include min.trj which was an output of the sander due to size (284MB) couldn't push to github.
