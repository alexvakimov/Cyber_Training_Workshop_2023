Results of project and the report. 

Files included, 

All .gifs, .pdfs from g-CTMQC outputs as well as the .f90 file to which I added my model. 

Excel sheet containing all calculated adibatic energies and plots of PECs

Maple worksheet containing fitting data and diabatic transformation

Results of equilibrium calculation in OpenMolCAS(all inputs and outputs). I did not include this for all geometries since they would be fairly repetitive but they are in my Student directory under /projects/academic/cyberwksp21/Students/jstetzler/Project/OpenMOLCAS_Calculations/More_Excited_States

As well, ad pdf of the report(which does not have working .gifs) and a word file(with working .gifs) along with the power point presentation are included

Update 7/22/22

Neede to redo diabatic couplings as NACs were wrong. TSHFS and CTMQC folders with "NEW PEC" are results with new coupling state. Maple file updated with new calculations, old calculations and data still present but commented out in "Fitting Trasnformation Sigma.mw". New data also present in the excel file "Data2". No new MOLCAS calculations were performed so no new files are included there.

New analytic potentials.f90 file also added, which includes new diabatic couplings and surfaces. The coupling is not exactly as the one in ample as I continued to change some parameters to see if I could better reproduce the adibatic states and the coupling region. 

New project report and powerpoint replaced the old ones.

All old data is still present
